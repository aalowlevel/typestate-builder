# typestate-builder-macro

`TypestateBuilder` is a Rust procedural macro that enables the creation of builder patterns using the typestate design pattern. This macro ensures that your structs are built in a way that enforces compile-time safety, ensuring that required fields are initialized before the struct is created.

For more information, read [the document of the consumer crate](https://docs.rs/typestate-builder/latest/typestate_builder/).
